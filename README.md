# Amazon-s-annual-bestsellers-VS-NYT-bestsellers-2009-2021
This project explores the convergence between Amazon’s annual top-100 bestsellers and The New York Times weekly bestsellers from 2009 to 2021(The links to these two datasets can be downloaded from Kraggle).It quantifies overlap rates, identifies key drivers of convergence,analyzes timing relationships, and provides actionable insights for publishers,authors, and industry stakeholders. 
Part 0: Load both datasets, standardize column names and types, and build a shared match key for reliable cross-source linking.
Part 1: Identify books appearing in both datasets and build a merged table aligned by title-author and year.
Part 2: Compute yearly overlap counts and rates to see how convergence changes from 2009–2021.
Part 3: Compare genre distributions and overlap rates to find which genres converge most between Amazon and NYT.
Part 4: Contrast ratings, reviews, and prices for Amazon-only vs dual-listed books to assess performance differences tied to convergence.
Part 5: Relate NYT rank to Amazon metrics to test whether Amazon popularity proxies NYT chart position.
Part 6: Measure first-appearance timing gaps to determine which list tends to lead and by how much.
Part 7: Link NYT weeks-on-list with Amazon metrics to see if sustained NYT presence aligns with Amazon engagement.
Part 8: Evaluate NYT rank and persistence by price bands to test whether pricing correlates with convergence strength.
Part 9: Detect multi-year Amazon bestsellers to quantify persistence that may drive repeated convergence.
Part 10: Compare top authors and author overlap to understand creator-level drivers of convergence.
Part 11: Visualize core findings (overlap trend, genre mix, rating splits, price–rating scatter) to make convergence patterns clear.
Part 12: Provide optional deeper diagnostics (timing histogram, persistence vs reviews, price-range rank, longevity distribution).
Part 13: Plot author leaderboards for Amazon and NYT to highlight shared and divergent author dominance.
Part 14: Export key result tables for grading, replication, and downstream reporting.
Part 15: Print a concise summary of convergence levels, peaks/lows, genre effects, timing, and persistence.
